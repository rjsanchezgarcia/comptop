The capture of Saddam Hussein:

shows the strong predictive power of networks.  

 underlies the need to obtain accurate maps of the networks we aim to study; and the often heroic difficulties we encounter during the mapping process.

 demonstrates the remarkable stability of these networks:  The capture of Hussein was not based on fresh intelligence, but rather on his pre-invasion social links, unearthed from old photos stacked in his family album.

 shows that the choice of network we focus on makes a huge difference: the hierarchical tree, that captured the official organization of the Iraqi government, was of no use when it came to Saddam Hussein's whereabouts.
