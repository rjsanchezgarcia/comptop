    "## 1.1 Basic Terminology\n",
    "### Definition of Graph\n",
    "**Definition.** A **graph** is a pair $G=(V,E)$ where $V$ is a non-empty set of **vertices** and $E \\subseteq V \\times V$ is a set of **directed edges**. We call $e=(i,j)\\in E$ an **edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$** (sometimes $i$ and $j$ are called **source** respectively **target** of $e$). If $i=j$, we call $(i,i)$ a **loop** at vertex $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition.** A graph is **undirected** if, for all $i,j \\in V$, we have $(i,j) \\in E \\iff (j,i) \\in E$. Otherwise, we call the graph **directed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition.** For an undirected graph, we define a **undirected edge**, or simply an **edge**, **between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$** as the set $\\{i,j\\}=\\{j,i\\}$, provided that $(i,j) \\in E$ (or, equivalently $(j,i) \\in E$). We write $\\widetilde{E}$ for the set of undirected edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition.** A graph is **loopless** if $(i,i) \\not\\in E$ for all $i \\in V$, and **finite** if $V$, and therefore $E$, are finite sets. If the graph is finite, we define its **vertex size**, respectively its **edge size**, as $|V|$, respectively $|\\widetilde{E}|$ (or $|E|$ if the graph is directed). \n",
    "\n",
    "If a graph (network) is finite, we will label the vertices 1 to $n=|V|$ and, for convenience, assume $V=\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$, unless stated otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remarks.*\n",
    "1.  As we are using them to model real-world systems, *we will assume from now on that all our graphs (networks) are finite*.\n",
    "2. The network structure is independent of the chosen labelling (formally, it is a graph isomorphism, see Practice Problems). \n",
    "3. Our definition does not allow multi-edges (multiple edges between vertices). There are ways of modifying the definition of graph to incorporate multi-edges (see Practice Problems). \n",
    "4. A loop has a representation as a directed $(i,i)$ or undirected $\\{i\\}$ edge.\n",
    "5. A undirected edge $\\{i,j\\}$ can be seen as two directed edges $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$. With this interpretation, we can see undirected graphs as special types of directed graphs. \n",
    "6. Conversely, we can see a directed graph as an undirected graph by 'forgetting' the directions. Formally, this is the graph with one undirected edge $\\{i,j\\}$ whenever $(i,j) \\in E$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Weights\n",
    "It will be often useful to encode *weights* in our network models. Consider a graph $G=(V,E)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition** A **vertex weight function** is a map $w \\colon V \\to \\mathbb{R}$. An **edge weight function** is a map $w \\colon E \\to \\mathbb{R}$. If the graph is undirected, we also require $w(i,j)=w(j,i)$ for all $(i,j)\\in E$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will extend an edge weight function to $w \\colon V \\times V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by defining $w(i,j)=0$ if $(i,j) \\not\\in E$, and also call it an **edge weight function**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Remarks.*\n",
    "1. One could encode qualitative properties of the vertices or edges such as 'infected'/'susceptible' (e.g. vertices in an epidemic model) or 'inhibitory/excitatory' (e.g.edges representing synapses in a neural network) by changing the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$ in the definition of $w$ to an arbitrary label set $L$. In this course, however, we will focus only on quantitative (numerical) weights as defined above.\n",
    "2. Moreover, we will restrict ourselves to positive weights, that is, $w \\colon V \\to \\mathbb{R}^+$ or $w \\colon E \\to \\mathbb{R}^+$. (In most cases, one can shift all weights, by adding an appropriate constant, to ensure this condition is satisfied.) In this case, the extended edge weight function $w\\colon V \\times V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $w(i,j)=0$ if and only if $(i,j) \\not\\in E$; in particular, we can recover the edge set $E$ from $w$. \n",
    "3. If we label the vertices $V=\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$, a vertex weight function corresponds to a vector of length $n$, $(w(1),w(2),\\ldots,w(n))$, and an edge weight function to an $n \\times n$ matrix with $(i,j)$-entry $w(i,j)$. \n",
    "4. We will sometimes write $w_i$ or $w_{ij}$ instead of $w(i)$ or $w(i,j)$ when the weight function $w$ is clear from the context. \n",
    "5. Any unweighted graph can be seen as a weighted graph with constant 1 weight functions $w \\colon V \\to \\mathbb{R}^+$ or $w \\colon E \\to \\mathbb{R}^+$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since edge weights are more common in network modelling, we define a **weighted** network as a network (graph) with an *edge* weight function. For vertex weights, we use the expression **vertex-weighted** network. \n",
    "\n",
    "> To simplify the terminology, we assume all graphs (networks) to be undirected and unweighted unless stated otherwise (by using the words 'directed' or 'weighted'). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Degree\n",
    "The **degree** of a vertex is the number of vertices it is connected to. We will write $d_i$ for the degree of vertex $i \\in V$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the graph is *directed*, we will distinguish between **in-** and **out-degree**\n",
    "$$\\begin{align} \n",
    "    d_i^{in} &= |\\{ j \\in V \\text{ such that } (j,i) \\in E\\}\\\\\n",
    "    d_i^{out} &= |\\{ j \\in V \\text{ such that } (i,j) \\in E\\}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "If the graph is undirected, $d^{in}_i=d^{out}_i=d_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the graph is also *weighted*, we define the **weighted in-** and **out-degree** as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "    d_i^{w,in} = \\sum_{j \\in V} w(j,i)\\\\\n",
    "    d_i^{w,out} = \\sum_{j \\in V} w(i,j)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "If the graph is undirected, $d_i^{w,in}=d_i^{w,out}=d_i^{w}$ and we simply call it the **weighted degree** of vertex $i$, written $d_i^{w}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Remarks.*\n",
    "1. If the graph is unweighted, the weighted degree (see Remark 5 in the previous section) coincides with its degree. \n",
    "2. For directed graphs, we also define the **total degree** as $d_i^{total} = d_i^{in} + d_i^{out}$."

    "## Matrices associated to graphs\n",
    "We will associate matrices to graphs (networks). The algebraic properties of these matrices reflect the structural properties of the network. Hence, we will use matrices and their properties (e.g. eigenvalues/vectors) to study networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on those properties that are more relevant/useful for networks representing real-world systems. However, this is a *huge* subject that goes under the name *Algebraic Graph Theory* and even *Spectral Graph Theory* (the sub-discipline that focus on the properties relating to the spectrum -set of eigenvalues- of such matrices). In the bibliography you can find whole *books* on these topics. \n",

If the graph is directed, we change the definition so that the $(i,j)$-entry is $-1$ if $i$ is the initial vertex of vertex $j$, $1$ if \n",
